MILESTONE 2

Github Link:- https://github.com/IncyBot/Constantius

Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

Project Scope:- Help students to be on track of their academic schedule.
Aim: 
To address these difficulties, an efficient and tailored solution that can aid students in designing and adhering to a study schedule is required. A solution of this type would have to take into account each student's unique learning style, interests, and learning pace. It would also need to provide personalised coaching and support to help students overcome obstacles and stay motivated. In addition, the solution must include appropriate instructional resources and activities matched to the student's interests and learning style.
  
Motivation: 
  In today's fast-paced world, education has become a crucial component of success. Sadly, many students struggle to reach their academic goals owing to a variety of issues, including inadequate time management skills, a lack of motivation, and insufficient assistance. As a result, many students, despite their best efforts, do not complete their education or reach their full potential.
  One of the most challenging obstacles that students encounter is setting and keeping to a study routine. Students frequently struggle to efficiently manage their time, resulting in a lack of development and poor academic performance. This is especially true for students with diverse learning styles, interests, and learning paces. Furthermore, students who lack desire or experience personal or academic challenges may find it difficult to keep on track with their studies, leading to greater dissatisfaction and demotivation.

UPDATE:
We have successfully implemented the login functionality on our webpage, allowing users to securely access their accounts. (however, there seems to be a problem which we are unable to rectify at the moment) 
Additionally, we have integrated an event scheduler into our platform, providing users with the ability to manage and organize their upcoming events effectively.
